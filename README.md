Hi, I'm [Nathan Fulton](https://nfulton.org)!

## Professional Bio

I am a Manager at the MIT-IBM AI Lab in Cambridge, MA. Right now I'm spending a lot of my time [Mellea](https://github.com/generative-computing/mellea), a library for writing generative programs.

I earned a Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Science Department, where I was a member of Andr√© Platzer's 
Logical Systems Lab and a core developer of the KeYmaera X theorem prover for hybrid systems. 
KeYmaera X demonstrates how formal methods techniques can improve the safety and trustworthiness of autonomous planes, 
magnetic control systems, and embedded devices.

During my first stint at IBM Research, I continued work in this direction -- using hybrid systems verification tooling to build verifiable 
safety guarantees for reinforcement learning algorithms.

I was then a Senior Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services for a couple of years, where I worked on [CodeWhisperer](https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/), an ML-powered coding companion.

I'm now back at IBM Research working on [generative computing](https://www.ibm.com/think/news/how-generative-computing-reinvent-software).
