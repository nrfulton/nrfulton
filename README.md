Hi, I'm Nathan Fulton!

## Professional Bio

I am a Manager at the MIT-IBM AI Lab in Cambridge, MA.

I earned a Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Science Department, where I was a member of Andr√© Platzer's 
Logical Systems Lab and a core developer of the KeYmaera X theorem prover for hybrid systems. 
KeYmaera X demonstrates how formal methods techniques can improve the safety and trustworthiness of autonomous planes, 
magnetic control systems, and embedded devices.

Prior to rejoining IBM, I was a  Senior Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services where I worked on [CodeWhisperer](https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/), an ML-powered coding companion.
Prior to Amazon, I was a Research Staff Member in MIT-IBM AI Lab, where I worked on theory and tooling for 
building safe autonomous systems. While at MIT-IBM, I used hybrid systems verification tooling to build verifiable 
safety guarantees for reinforcement learning algorithms. and collaborated with researchers at MIT and IBM on theory and 
tooling for other types of neural-symbolic systems.
